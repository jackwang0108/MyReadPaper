# MyReadPaper

This repository stores all of the paper that I've read. And each paper is coming with my comments. The comments including my understanding, thinking and some ideas. Since I'm a Chinese native speaker, comment in Chinese makes me fluent in reading, so, unfortunately, most of the comments are in Chinese. But I hope this repository could still be informative/inspiring/useful for you. Moreover, this repository serves as a witness of my paper reading experience/science research.
